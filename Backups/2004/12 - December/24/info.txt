Made a better image (512x512 instead of 256x256, and has alpha channel). Made that work. Now to write the rest of the display code. Also fixed the normal for the "Score" quad. Scoring display works just fine, so the number drawing code seems to work. Needs to be tested with other numbers (like a 2 digit number), but should work. Will need to figure something out incase score gets over 999999.
