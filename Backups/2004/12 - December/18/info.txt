Renamed the pieceCanFit function to checkForCollision, and made it so pieces can move anywhere they should be able to. Things are looking good! Got rid of the pointless FindSquares.py file. Made sure everything had a docstring. Square removal works fine. Renamed another method or two in GameBoard.py. Scoring should work. Added a few more notifications which are disabled. They will represent things like sounds later. The extra stage on the right side is set up where we will display status info. Removed the three "test" blocks that were there by default. Time to add scoring, display, etc.
