Made piece placement work, removed arbitrary angle stuff because that will never be needed. Got rid of the "Notes.txt" file. Pieces and their colors are randomly generated. Piece can't be placed in the "magic" square, but they can't be placed up against an edge if there is a blank row/column and they can be moved freely, so things need some fix'n. But movents (x, y, and rotation) are checked so you can only move a piece where you should be able to (with the exception of the bug listed above).
